# Setup

1. Install the environet project. Refer to [Setup](11_setup.md).

2. Create a distribution node configuration
   `./environet dist install`
   
3. Initialize database, and create admin user
   `./environet dist init database`

After going through these steps, the distribution node should be up and running. You can access the admin panel at YOUR_IP/admin.
