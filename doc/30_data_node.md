# Data node

## Overview
A *data node* is designed to be run at a data source with the purpose of gathering metering point measurements stored in some third party format, such as a plain text file, spreadsheet or web resource.  

It transforms these data to a format compatible with the Environet *distribution node* API, and uploads the results to a distribution node.  

The gathering and uploading of data is accomplished by way of uploader plugin configurations, which can then be run by calling a script, typically by a cron job.

Before a data node can start uploading measurements, the metering points and observable properties (for which the plugin will upload measurements) have to be configured beforehand on the Environet distribution node that the plugin will be uploading to.  
   
An API user with will also need to be configured, to authenticate upload requests.  

## Prepare distribution node to receive data

You can set the following up if you have access to the [distribution node admin panel](25_admin_user_manual.md).

**API user**  
  
  Configure a new or existing user with **public ssl key** for . Click [here](#ssl-key-pair-generation-tool) if you need help creating SSL keys.
  Take note of the **username**, you are going to need it later - along with the **private key** - to configure your data node.

**Observed properties**  
  
  Check that the distribution node has an *observed property* corresponding to each type of data to be uploaded.
  Take note of the **symbol** value of these for later.

**Monitoring points**
  
  Finally, define the monitoring points for which data will be uploaded.  
  **You will have to link observed properties to each monitoring point as well.**

## Setup steps

Before configuring the data node, you need to install the Environet project. The steps to install dependencies and download the Environet source itself, are outlined in the [setup](11_setup.md) section of this document.

**Configure data directory**
  
If your data node will be reading data from a file or directory on the system where the node is running, you will have to configure the LOCAL_DATA_DIR environment variable with the path to the directory where the data will be found.  
If the data node is going to access the measurements over a network connection, you can skip this step.

- Create an `.env` file by copying `.env.example`
- Uncomment the line containing LOCAL_DATA_DIR (by deleting the # character from the beginning of the line)
- Enter the path to the data directory. For example:
  On a system where the measurements are stored in csv files in the `/var/measurements` directory, the line would read:`LOCAL_DATA_DIR=/var/measurements`

## Creating configurations
    
Run `./environet data plugin create` to start an interactive script, that will guide you through creating an uploader plugin configuration.  

Generated configurations will be saved to the `/conf/plugins/configurations` folder, with the filename provided at the end of the process.  

## Running a configuration

Run `./environet plugin run [configuration name]` to run an uploader plugin configuration. (If you want to run regularly, you should set up a cron job to execute this command at regular intervals.)

## SSL key pair generation tool
To generate an ssl key pair, you can run the command `./environet data tool keygen`.  
Private keys should be placed in the `conf/plugins/credentials` directory, which is where the keygen tool will place them, by default.
