# Setup

This guide assumes you are installing Environet in a Linux environment.

## Install the Docker Engine and Docker Compose


### Docker Engine
The docker documentation has lots of helpful information, along with distribution specific installation instructions. If you are new to Docker, we recommend reading the [overview](https://docs.docker.com/install/) first.  
To see distribution specific installation instructions, navigate to Docker Engine > Linux > Your distribution in the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

Be sure to follow the [post installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) to allow using docker as a non-root user.

You can verify that Docker is installed correctly by running:  
`$ docker run hello-world`  
If should output a friendly message to the terminal.

### Docker Compose
Setting up Compose is a simpler process, which is described in detail on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems).  
It involves downloading the docker-compose binary from github and setting executable permissions on it.

You can verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly by running:  
`$ docker-compose --version`  
It should output the currently installed version number.

## Get the source

You will need to have Git installed to be able to download the project source, and to receive updates later. It is easiest to install Git on Linux using the preferred package manager of your Linux distribution. See the [Git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) for details.

Checkout the Environet docker repository
  - Navigate to the directory where you would like to install environet  
  - Run `$ git clone https://github.com/environet/environet-docker.git --recurse-submodules`  
    
   By default, the files will be downloaded to a directory named `environet-docker`, you can specify a custom name by providing a third argument to the command, e.g.:  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/environet/environet-docker.git my_directory --recurse-submodules`
   
   Note: If you cloned the repository without the `--recurse-submodules` flag, you need to run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`, to get the src files checked out.

Change to the directory you checked the code out to, and you should be ready to proceed with the setup.  

  If you are installing a data node, refer to the data node [setup instructions](#30_data_node)  

  If you are installing a distribution node, refer to the distribution node [setup instructions](#21_setup)
  
## Getting updates and maintenance

The `environet` cli script is a wrapper for some docker containers managed with docker compose. After first starting a *dist* or *data* node, these services will start automatically after a system reboot.  
To stop and start them manually, you may run `./environet data up` or `./environet data down` (`./environet dist up` and `./environet dist down` in case of a distribution node).  

To get the latest version, simply run `git pull` in the repository folder.

# Distribution node

## Overview

A Distribution node, in it’s minimal form, is a service aspect that’s able to maintain the central database and service API requests. 
In the first phase the domain of the distribution node is: [https://environet.environ.hu](https://environet.environ.hu)

## Central database

The distribution node has a database backend. It contains:
* Data and configuration of hydro and meteo points
* Measurement data tables of these monitoring points
* User and access (ACL) tables (users, groups, permissions)
* System runtime data

Schema of the database can be found here: [Database structure](#21_database_structure)

## Administration area

On the administration area, administrators can maintain:
* The data and configuration of monitoring points and observed properties
* Operators
* Users, groups, and their permissions (ACL)
* Public keys of operator-users

The url of the administration area: https://distribution-node.com/admin


## API endpoints

### Upload

With this endpoint data nodes can upload data of some monitoring points.  
The detailed documentation of this endpoint can found here: [Upload API documentation](#22_api_upload)

### Download

With this endpoint clients can query data from the distribution node.
This endpoint is available only after authentication, and authorization, so only permitted users can run queries. 
The response can be filtered by date, monitoring point type, and some other properties.  
The detailed documentation of this endpoint can found here: [Download API documentation](#23_api_download)


<a name="21_setup"></a>

# Setup

1. Install the environet project. Refer to [Setup](#11_setup).

2. Create a distribution node configuration
   `./environet dist install`
   
3. Initialize database, and create admin user
   `./environet dist database init`

After going through these steps, the distribution node should be up and running. You can access the admin panel at YOUR_IP/admin.

# Updates

After updating your deployment, you need to run `./environet dist database migrate`, to run any database migrations that might be included in the update.  

<a name="22_database_structure"></a>

# Database structure

## Database engine

* Required database engine is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* Version compatibility: 12+

### Signature header:

The pattern of the header: `Signature keyId="[username]",algorithm="rsa-sha256",signature="[signature]"`

The `keyId` is the username of the uploader user.
The `signature` part is the base64 encoded openssl signature which was created with the user's private key 
from the from the body of the response, which is the XML data.

# Admin user manual

This document's goals to represents the different parts of the administration area to help to understand how it works. Help you to see through how works the specified relationships and how you can handle them.










<a name="25_1_admin_general"></a>

## General information
Good to know, that on each list page, there are on the top right a search field. In the following each sections you can see a "searchable" part, where you can find in what kind of fields can the system search on the specified page.


<a name="25_2_auth"></a>

## Auth pages

#### Login page

Path: `/admin/login`

Here you have to type your credentials data to login into the administration area. 
If you have no login credentials yet, you have to gain access from your webmaster.

#### Logout
You can logout if you click the exit icon on the top right of the page.

Path: `/admin/logout`

<a name="25_3_dashboard"></a>

## Dashboard

Path: `/admin`

<a name="25_4_users"></a>

## Users
Here you can handle the users who has already added to the system.

Path: `/admin/users`

Searchable: name, username, email

**There are three types of user:**
-  Distribution node 
-  Client node
-  Users who can manage the system in the admin area

All of them are listed in the users grid. 

Each user, except the user type users have to have public key attached to themselves, because of they are communicate on API channel and it necessary to their authentication.

#### New user

You can add new user if you click the "Add user" button on the top left of the users list page.

Path: `/admin/users/add`

On the user's creating page, you have to fill the following mandatory fields:
- name
- email - it must be unique
- username - it must be unique
- permission or group

The public key field is necessary only if we want to create a client or distrubition node user. In other case if you would like to create a "system manager" user, you have to fill to password field instead of public key.

If you wouldn't like to assign a specified permission to the user, you must assign the user to a group, they will inherits the group's permissions.


#### Updating user

You can select a user to update if you click the "Pencil" icon at the end of the specific row.

Path: `/admin/users/edit?id=[user identifier]`

You can update all user datas that you gave on the creating page except the username field. 

#### User deleting

You can delete a user if you click the "Trash" icon at the end of the specific row. If you clicked, it shows a confirm window, where you have to approve the deleting. In fact the deleted user will never physically deleted, we have to keep its datas by security reasons.

Path: `/admin/users/delete?id=[user identifier]`

<a name="25_5_groups"></a>

## Groups
Here you can handle the groups what has already added to the  system.

Path: `/admin/groups`

Searchable: name

#### New group

You can add new group if you click the "Add group" button on the top left of the group list page.

Path: `/admin/groups/add`

On the group's creating page you have to fill the name of the group and you have to assign permission to the specified group. On the creating page, you can assign only one permission, but later you have possibility to add more of it.

#### Updating group

You can select a group to update if you click the "Pencil" icon at the end of the specific row.

Path: `/admin/groups/edit?id=[group identifier]`

Here you can change the name of the group and you can assign more permission to it.

#### Group deleting

You can delete a group if you click the "Trash" icon at the end of the specific row. If you clicked, it shows a confirm window, where you have to approve the deleting. **If any user or operator have already assigned to the specified group, the delete operation cannot be performed.**
First time you have to detach these relations and after that you can delete the group.

Path: `/admin/groups/delete?id=[group identifier]`

<a name="25_6_data_providers"></a>

## Data providers
Here you can handle the data providers what has already added to the  system.

Path: `/admin/data-providers`

Searchable: name, address, email

#### New data provider

You can add new data provider if you click the "Add data provider" button on the top left of the data provider's list page.

Path: `/admin/data-providers/add`

On the data providers creating page, you have to fill the following mandatory fields:

Operator data
 - name
 - phone
 - e-mail
 - url

User data
- name
- username
- email

The user data is necessary because of each operator has to be assigned to at least one user.

#### Updating data provider

You can select a data provider to update if you click the "Pencil" icon at the end of the specific row.

Path: `/admin/data-providers/edit?id=[data-provider identifier]`

Here you can change all of operator's data and you can assign  more users or groups to the specific dataprovider.

#### Data provider show page

You can select a data provider to show if you click the "Eye" icon at the end of the specific row.

Path: `/admin/data-providers/show?id=[data-provider identifier]`

Here you can see the stored data of the data providers and its relations to direction of users and groups.

#### Data provider deleting

You cannot delete any data provider.

## Measurement access rules


### Concept of the rules

The access rules controls the time interval in which the data will be available for a user under the [download API](#24_api_download) request. 

The rules have three required dimensions: 
* **Monitoring point** - the rule is for all data of the given monitoring point 
* **Observed property** - the rule is for all data of the observed property of the monitoring point
* **User groups** - the rule will be applied if the requesting user is under these groups

The rules has one additional optional dimension:
* **Operator** - If an operator creates the rule, these property will be set automatically. An administrator can set is optionally. 
This property controls which rule will be visible under operator's acces rule list, and important in case of wildcard (*) rules. 
If the operator parameter is set, the wildcard (*) will be applied only for points/properties under the given operator.

If the rule matches for a [download API](#24_api_download) request (so the __user__ getting data for the __monitoring point__ and the __observed property__), the user can retrieve data only in the given time period.
This period's end is the current date, and the start is controlled by the `years`, `months` and `days` paramter of the access rule.

The monitoring point and the observed property can be a *, which will match all monitoring points (globally, or of an operator), or all properties. 

The rules will be "merged" before checking user's access level.

#### Rule list

On the list page all rules are visible, with the required and optional dimensions.

Path: `/admin/measurement-access-rules`

#### New access rule

You can add new access rule if you click the "Add rule" button on the top left of the rules list page.

Path: `/admin/measurements-access-rules/add`

On the rules's creating page, you have to fill the following mandatory fields:
- Monitoring point selector - The ID of the monitoring point, or * for all
- Observed property selector - The ID (symbol) of the monitoring point, or * for all
- Groups - Multiple user groups can be selected
- At least one of the time interval fields: years, months, days

Optionally you can select an operator, in this case wildcard (*) will be applied for items only under the give operator.

#### Updating access rule

You can select a rule to update if you click the "Pencil" icon at the end of the specific row.

Path: `/admin/measurements-access-rules/edit?id=[rule identifier]`

You can update all rule datas that you gave on the creating page. 

#### Rule deleting

You can delete a rule if you click the "Trash" icon at the end of the specific row. If you clicked, it shows a confirm window, where you have to approve the deleting.

# Data node

## Overview
A *data node* is designed to be run at a data source with the purpose of gathering metering point measurements stored in some third party format, such as a plain text file, spreadsheet or web resource.  

It transforms these data to a format compatible with the Environet *distribution node* API, and uploads the results to a distribution node.  

The gathering and uploading of data is accomplished by way of uploader plugin configurations, which can then be run by calling a script, typically by a cron job.

Before a data node can start uploading measurements, the metering points and observable properties (for which the plugin will upload measurements) have to be configured beforehand on the Environet distribution node that the plugin will be uploading to.  
   
An API user with will also need to be configured, to authenticate upload requests.  

## Prepare distribution node to receive data

You can set the following up if you have access to the [distribution node admin panel](#25_admin_user_manual).

**API user**  
  
  Configure a new or existing user with **public ssl key** for . Click [here](#ssl-key-pair-generation-tool) if you need help creating SSL keys.
  Take note of the **username**, you are going to need it later - along with the **private key** - to configure your data node.

**Observed properties**  
  
  Check that the distribution node has an *observed property* corresponding to each type of data to be uploaded.
  Take note of the **symbol** value of these for later.

**Monitoring points**
  
  Finally, define the monitoring points for which data will be uploaded.  
  **You will have to link observed properties to each monitoring point as well.**

## Setup steps

Before configuring the data node, you need to install the Environet project. The steps to install dependencies and download the Environet source itself, are outlined in the [setup](#11_setup) section of this document.

**Configure data directory**
  
If your data node will be reading data from a file or directory on the system where the node is running, you will have to configure the LOCAL_DATA_DIR environment variable with the path to the directory where the data will be found.  
If the data node is going to access the measurements over a network connection, you can skip this step.

- Create an `.env` file by copying `.env.example`
- Uncomment the line containing LOCAL_DATA_DIR (by deleting the # character from the beginning of the line)
- Enter the path to the data directory. For example:
  On a system where the measurements are stored in csv files in the `/var/measurements` directory, the line would read:`LOCAL_DATA_DIR=/var/measurements`

## Creating configurations
    
Run `./environet data plugin create` to start an interactive script, that will guide you through creating an uploader plugin configuration.  

Generated configurations will be saved to the `/conf/plugins/configurations` folder, with the filename provided at the end of the process.  

## Running a configuration

Run `./environet plugin run [configuration name]` to run an uploader plugin configuration. (If you want to run regularly, you should set up a cron job to execute this command at regular intervals.)

## SSL key pair generation tool
To generate an ssl key pair, you can run the command `./environet data tool keygen`.  
Private keys should be placed in the `conf/plugins/credentials` directory, which is where the keygen tool will place them, by default.

# SSL key pair generation guide

## Windows
It is recommended to use the following:

[https://itefix.net/dl/free-software/openssl_tool_win_x64_1.0.0.zip](https://itefix.net/dl/free-software/openssl_tool_win_x64_1.0.0.zip)

Download and extract it to an optional place. In the package, you can find the executable file at the: 
*bin/openssl.exe*

If you open the exe, it will prompt a command window, wherein you have to type the following lines:

**1.** Private key generation:  
`genrsa -out private.pem 2048`
  
**2.** Public key generation from private key:  
`rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout`

## Linux

You have to download one from the following link:

[https://www.openssl.org/source/](https://www.openssl.org/source/)

After that you have to extract and install it.

Here you can find a detailed description about the installation:

[https://www.tecmint.com/install-openssl-from-source-in-centos-ubuntu/](https://www.tecmint.com/install-openssl-from-source-in-centos-ubuntu/)

After the installation you have to run these commands:

**1.** Private key generation:  
`openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048`
  
**2.** Public key generation from private key:  
`openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout`

# Other Environet tools

Useful CLI tools which are available through the './environet' wrapper script.

### Generating keypair

Command: `./environet dist|data tool keygen`

Description:
With this command you gen generate a openssl keypair with an interactive process. The command will ask for:
* Destination folder of the key files
* Prefix for the key file names

Based on these data a keypair will be generated, and stored in the destination folder.

### Sign content

Command: `./environet dist|data tool sign`

Description:
With this command you gen sign a content (a string, or a file) with a private key. The command will ask for:
* Relative path of private key file
* How do you want to enter the content (file, or pasted string)
* The file path (in case of 'file' mode) or the raw string (in case of 'pasted string' mode)
* Generate md5 hash before sigining, or not

Based on the input data a base64 encoded signature will be generated, which can be used in the Authorization header of any api request.
